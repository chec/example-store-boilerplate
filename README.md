# Commerce.js boilerplate

This repository contains a bare-bones example store to see how Commerce.js works. The templates use Bootstrap for
some basic styling.

## Requirements

You will need the following to run this store:

* NodeJS, v8/10 or newer
* Yarn, or npm

## Getting started

To run the store (from your command line):

* Clone this project, e.g. `git clone git@github.com:chec/example.store.git cjs-boilerplate`
* Navigate into the folder, e.g. `cd cjs-boilerplate`
* Install the dependencies, e.g. `yarn` or `npm install`
* Start the dev server, e.g. `yarn hot` or `npm run hot`

This will start a local server running on http://localhost:8080, which you can use to test it out.
